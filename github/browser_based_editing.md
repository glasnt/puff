# Editing GitHub repos via the website/browser

For repos large or small, you can edit it's contents using the browser. 

GitHub support has helpful docs for this! 

<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository>

On top of this: 

 * it's very useful if you have a very large repo, because it allows you to make edits (proposed or direct) without cloning the full repo.
 * if you don't own the repo (or have write access), the UI will prompt you to clone the repo, and help you create a pull request.

Side effects:
 * you're using a browser and not a full IDE, so linting etc might catch you out.
   * if you're feeling really fancy, there's [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for that.
  
Bonus features

  * (the main source of this TIL) (this could have been a TIL in itself): Control + S (Command + S on MacOS) will bring up the 'Commit changes...' screen, like you were saving the file. Neat!
